                    <p>
                        Because of the outbreak of COVID-19, people all over the world have to stay at home to work and
                        study.
                        Remote/hybrid work is continuing and trending permanently.
                        That means people located in different cities or countries gather together online.
                        Our group finds that it is very time-consuming and error-prone to convert the time difference,
                        which
                        makes
                        things, such as scheduling meeting time and figuring out deadlines of work, harder.
                    </p>

                        The key users of our application would be <em>students/employees</em> who need to keep track of
                        different
                        time zones.
                        For example, international students who traveled from Asia to the United States.
                        They want to keep in touch with their friends from their home countries; however, it is
                        <strong>hard
                            to keep
                            track
                            of two different time zones</strong> to find a good time to talk with each other.
                        For some large companies, they have employees all over the world. Sometimes they need to
                        schedule
                        meetings
                        with each other in different time zones.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our application would allow users to create a list of time zones they choose to keep track of.
                        More specifically, the users can create a list of time zones by selecting from a list of
                        provided
                        time
                        zones.
                        When the users want to schedule meetings with others, they can always see what the meeting time
                        is
                        in the
                        other user's time zone.
                        Thus, they can find a perfect time for meeting with each other.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not only can users create a list of time zones they choose to keep track of, they can also add
                        events to
                        their “remind list.”
                        More specifically, users can input information about an event such as
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Event name</li>
                        <li>Your date and time</li>
                        <li>Priority type</li>
                    </ul>
