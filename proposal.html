        <h2>Problem and Data Domain</h2>
        <p>
            Because of the outbreak of COVID-19, people all over the world have to stay at home to work and study.
            Remote/hybrid work is continuing and trending permanently (Lydia Saad and Ben Wigert, 2022).
            That means people located in different cities or countries gather together online.
            Our group finds that it is very time-consuming and error-prone to convert the time difference, which makes
            things, such as scheduling meeting time and figuring out deadlines of work, harder.
        </p>
        <p>
            Converting time zones and scheduling events automatically by writing a web application is tangible for
            solving the “planning hard” problem.
            We are interested in making <strong>a time zone converter</strong> with outstanding user experience, which
            can help the users
            to make time schedules and to-do lists easily and tangible.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are a lot of time converters on the internet.
            Take <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html" , target=_blank>timeanddate.com</a> as
            an instance.
            It is actually a very good example of alleviating the pain of converting time among locations that the users
            are interested in. It also has a feature of recognizing effective work time. When the location is during the
            daytime except for holidays, there is a green dot beside the location suggesting that the location is an
            effective work time. But things get a little bit more complex when the user wants to look at several periods
            of time at the same time.
            It is also hard to keep track of the event list on this website.
        </p>
        <p>
            We might also use <a href="https://timezonedb.com" , target=_blank>this website</a> which provides free API
            and Dataset.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
            The key users of our application would be <em>students/employees</em> who need to keep track of different
            time zones.
            For example, international students who traveled from Asia to the United States.
            They want to keep in touch with their friends from their home countries; however, it is <strong>hard to keep
                track
                of two different time zones</strong> to find a good time to talk with each other.
            For some large companies, they have employees all over the world. Sometimes they need to schedule meetings
            with each other in different time zones.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our application would allow users to create a list of time zones they choose to keep track of.
            More specifically, the users can create a list of time zones by selecting from a list of provided time
            zones.
            When the users want to schedule meetings with others, they can always see what the meeting time is in the
            other user's time zone.
            Thus, they can find a perfect time for meeting with each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not only can users create a list of time zones they choose to keep track of, they can also add events to
            their “remind list.”
            More specifically, users can input information about an event such as
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Event name</li>
            <li>Your date and time</li>
            <li>Priority type</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            After inputting the information needed, users are able to see the “target date and time” as well as other
            inserted information on their reminder list.
            We are going to draw data from a time zone database downloaded from <cite><a href="https://timezonedb.com/"
                    , target=_blank>timezonedb.com</a></cite>, which converts the inputed date and time to the “target
            date and time."
            The <strong> target date and time</strong> will be displayed on the user's remind list as well.
            This feature is going to help users’ keep track of their daily events, and never again should they worry
            about converting the time zone. Besides that powerful feature, our website also allows users to set a countdown timer.
            More specifically, users can input information about an event such as target date and time, and current date and time. 
            Then through our designed algarithm, a countdown timer will automatically be generated. This feature is going to help users assess the priority of each event on their list.
