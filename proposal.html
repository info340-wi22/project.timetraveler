        Because of the outbreak of COVID-19, people all over the world have to stay at home to work and study.
        Remote/hybrid work is continuing and trending permanently (Lydia Saad and Ben Wigert, 2022).
        That means people located in different cities or countries gather together online.
        Our group finds that it is very time-consuming and error-prone to convert the time difference, which makes
        things, such as scheduling meeting time and figuring out deadlines of work, harder.
    </p>
    <p>
        Converting time zones and scheduling events automatically by writing a web application is tangible for
        solving the “planning hard” problem.
        We are interested in making <strong>a time zone converter</strong> with outstanding user experience, which can help the users
        to make time schedules and to-do lists easily and tangible.

        There are a lot of time converters on the internet.
        Take <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html" , target=_blank>timeanddate.com</a> as
        an instance.
        It is actually a very good example of alleviating the pain of converting time among locations that the users
        are interested in. It also has a feature of recognizing effective work time. When the location is during the
        daytime except for holidays, there is a green dot beside the location suggesting that the location is an
        effective work time. But things get a little bit more complex when the user wants to look at several periods
        of time at the same time.
        It is also hard to keep track of the event list on this website.

        We might also use <a href="https://timezonedb.com" , target=_blank>this website</a> which provides free API
        and Dataset.

    <h2>App Description</h2>
    <section>
        <p>
            The key users of our application would be <em>students/employees</em> who need to keep track of different time zones.
            For example, international students who traveled from Asia to the United States.
            They want to keep in touch with their friends from their home countries; however, it is <strong>hard to keep track
            of two different time zones</strong> to find a good time to talk with each other.
            For some large companies, they have employees all over the world. Sometimes they need to schedule meetings
            with each other in different time zones.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our application would allow users to create a list of time zones they choose to keep track of.
            More specifically, the users can create a list of time zones by selecting from a list of provided time
            zones.
            When the users want to schedule meetings with others, they can always see what the meeting time is in the
            other user's time zone.
            Thus, they can find a perfect time for meeting with each other.
